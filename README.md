GifTastic

This is an easy gif finder application that has some suggested gif topic buttons already applied as well as a search bar that will search for any topic and will populate the page with a button for that topic.

If one of the buttons is pressed, the application will pull the top ten gifs from that category using the Giphy API. Each gif can be viewed by clicking on the gif image, and can be stopped by a second click on the gif image.

This application uses html with bootstrap for mobile responsiveness and javascript with jQuery for functionality. It makes Ajax calls to api.giphy.com.
